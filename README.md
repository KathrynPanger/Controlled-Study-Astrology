<p>Can horoscope readings accurately describe your day? If this is the case, then you should be able to tell the difference between a horoscope reading for your astrological sign and someone elses. This program shows you a random selection of 5 daily horoscopes pulled from the Aztro horoscope api. You are then prompted to guess which horoscope belongs to you. Your answer for the day is logged in a csv file in the same folder as astrotest.py program. The program then pulls your records of all the guesses you have made so far over N number of days and conducts a t-test to determine if the percent of your correct guesses up to this date have been significantly better than random chance (20% accuracy). It then reports your results. If your horoscopes describe your day better than someone elses, then after 30 days of testing, a report will be given that the null hypothesis is rejected and that your horoscopes might just be accurate! If not, then the program will report that we have failed to reject the null hypothesis, and your horoscopes do not seem to accurately reflect your daily experience- at least, no better than anyone elses horoscope.</p>
